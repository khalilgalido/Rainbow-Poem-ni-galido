Thoughts in my mind, Khalil G and Unicorn and ponies

My thoughts drift like clouds in the open sky
Carried by the wind of dreams passing by
Each moment a whisper of hope and chance
Life moving forward in a gentle dance
Even the quiet holds stories untold
Waiting for hearts that are brave and bold
So I walk on with my head held high
Chasing tomorrow with a fearless sigh
highest in the room
